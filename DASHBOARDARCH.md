DASHBOARDARCH
---

The general gist is to give a codeqa summary of the project and point to
individual reports. It will be merging one data group into a summary and
listing entities of the other data group.

# Datatypes

Two distinct data groups. One is where issues are listeed by class, ie cheeckstyle,
pmd, android lint and findbugs.

The other data group is by package or full project, ie jdepend and jacoco and instrumented
unit tests.

# Dashboard Implementation

1. First Summary page is a merge of checkstyle, findbugs, pmd, and android lint.
2. Second Summary page is summaries of jdpend, jacoco, javancss, and unit testing



# Credits

Oliver Becker came up with how to merge checkstyle, pmd, and findbugs.
